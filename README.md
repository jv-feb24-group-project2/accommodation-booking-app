This app is a booking accommodation application where people can advertise the places they want to rent out and where people looking for accommodations can search for them.  
Our goal? Streamline property management, empower customers, and redefine how you experience housing rentals.
Accommodation Booking App addresses key challenges:

For Customers: Simplifies finding accommodations as per their needs, provides Telegram Notifications Service for real-time updates and alerts, and ensures secure and cashless transactions through Stripe.

For Administrators: Provides comprehensive tools for inventory management, order booking, and real-time updates, making it easy to manage rental properties.

The Telegram Notifications Service is an integral part of our platform, providing users with instant notifications about booking confirmations, payment statuses, new property listings, and important updates directly through Telegram. This service enhances user experience by keeping them informed and engaged without the need to constantly check the app.   

Built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and Springdoc OpenAPI, Accommodation Booking App offers a secure and robust backend, perfect for supporting the operations of rental properties.
