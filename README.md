This app is a booking accommodation application where people can advertise the places they want to rent out and where people looking for accommodations can search for them.  
Our goal? Streamline property management, empower customers, and redefine how you experience housing rentals.
Accommodation Booking App addresses key challenges:

For Customers: Simplifies finding accommodations as per their needs, provides Telegram Notifications Service for real-time updates and alerts, and ensures secure and cashless transactions through Stripe.

For Administrators: Provides comprehensive tools for inventory management, order booking, and real-time updates, making it easy to manage rental properties.

The Telegram Notifications Service is an integral part of our platform, providing users with instant notifications about booking confirmations, payment statuses, new property listings, and important updates directly through Telegram. This service enhances user experience by keeping them informed and engaged without the need to constantly check the app.   

Built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and Springdoc OpenAPI, Accommodation Booking App offers a secure and robust backend, perfect for supporting the operations of rental properties.

üåéFeatures
üìùSwagger Documentation
Swagger is integrated into the project to provide comprehensive API documentation and facilitate testing of endpoints. With Swagger, you can visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

To access the Swagger UI and explore the API documentation:

Once the application is running, navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html in your web browser.

You will see the Swagger UI interface, where you can view all available endpoints, their descriptions, request parameters, and response schemas.

Use the interactive features of Swagger UI to make requests directly from the browser and observe the responses.

üèóÔ∏èInstallation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/k0sm0naft/java-online-book-store.git
cd java-online-book-store
Set Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root directory and populate it with the following environment variables:

MYSQLDB_USER=your_db_user_name
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_db_password
JWT_SECRET=yourVeryLongSecretStringForJwtSecretKey
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000

MYSQLDB_DATABASE=your_db_name
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=3306

SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
DEBUG_PORT=5005
Install dependencies and build the project:

mvn clean install
Build and Run the Docker Containers:

docker-compose up
Access the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html to access the Swagger API documentation.

Stop and Remove Containers: To stop and remove the containers created by the Compose file, use the docker-compose down command:

docker-compose down
üß™Running Tests
To run tests, use the following command:

mvn test
Testing with JUnit and Mockito

The project uses JUnit for unit testing and Mockito for mocking dependencies. This ensures that the application logic is tested in isolation, making the tests more reliable and easier to maintain.

üì¨Postman Collection
To facilitate testing, a Postman collection has been provided. You can import it into Postman and use it to test the API endpoints.

Run in Postman

To chose URL:
After you fork collection, you can register a new user, or use credentials below in the text.
After log in, the generated token will be automatically added to all next requests that required authentication.
